\section{Introduction}
MPI:
Citation 2, 3, 9 of \cite{lucka2000parallel}
\cite{chadha2002scalable}

OpenMP
\cite{lucka2000parallel}


GPU:
Comparing the two wavelet schemes on GPU:
filter bank vs. lifting. \cite{tenllado2008parallel}

Comparing a CUDA implementation with OpenMP implementation:
\cite{franco2009parallel}

A GPU+CPU approach, with performance comparison with OpenMP:
\cite{franco2010parallel}

The three main hardware architectures for the 2D DWT (row-column, line-based, block-based) are shown to be unsuitable for a CUDA implementation. Our CUDA-specific design can be regarded as a hybrid method between the row-column and block-based methods:
\cite{van2011accelerating}

3D wavelet reconstruction with "tileboarding". This approach is able
to achieve real-time reconstruction:
\cite{garcia2005gpu}

(This is a beginner level GPU-Wavelet paper)
GPU-wavelet on consumer-level GPUs:
\cite{wong2007discrete}

(IMPORTANT!)
GPU clusters! \cite{strengert2005large}

\section{Conclusion}
``I always thought something was fundamentally wrong with the universe''

\begin{abstract}
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is widely used in data reduction applications.
%
However, such transforms are relatively computationally intensive.
%
To accelerate the calculation of DWT, researchers have applied various parallel
computing techniques, based on the distributed memory architecture~\cite{
chadha2002scalable, woo1995parallel, uhl1996wavelet, nielsen1997scalable}
and the shared memory architecture~\cite{
lucka2000parallel, uhl2000optimization,kutil1999hardware}.
%
In the recent years, the many-core architecture, such as GPU acceleration 
cards, have emerged in the parallel computing field.
%
In this survey paper, we cover many topics regarding calculation of DWT on GPUs.
%
More specifically, we start the survey from technical discussion and evaluation
of implementing the DWT on GPUs~\cite{tenllado2008parallel, van2011accelerating,
garcia2005gpu}.
%
Then we present a few successful use cases of GPU in parallel DWT~\cite{
strengert2004hierarchical, strengert2006pyramid, wong2007discrete,
treib2012turbulence}.
%
Finally, to prepare for the exascale computing, we survey the use of 
heterogeneous architecture with GPUs and multi-core CPUs together,
as well as the GPU clusters~\cite{franco2009parallel, franco2010parallel,
strengert2005large, franco20122d, rossinelli2011multicore}.

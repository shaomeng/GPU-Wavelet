When performing DWT, the calculation of each coefficients depends only 
on a few input elements from its neighbors (see stencil pattern 
discussion in Section~\ref{sec:bg}).
%
This property makes the calculation of DWT fit in the 
Shared Memory Architecture (SMA) very well, 
by assigning each PE a small chunk of the input signal array
to operate on.
%
Research works from Kutil et. al. and Lucka et. al. both employ
this parallel scheme~\cite{kutil1999hardware, lucka2000parallel}.

Experiments by Kutil et. al. on the SGI POWERChallengeGR machine showed 
a linear speedup up to 10 PEs, while the parallel efficiency drops 
dramatically with more PEs.
%
The researchers than decided that the efficiency was hurt by 
cache misses when more PEs were involved in.
%
These observations and analyses are confirmed by Lucka et. al.
%
Their experiments and analyses showed similar speedup patterns
and performance impact by cache misses.
